  <blockquote>
    Director Tom Ossowski, who doubles as the musical director and conductor, sweats the details and reaps the benefits, with a sharply realized show that flows beautifully from beginning to end. He keeps his talented cast hopping with inspired staging, where every gesture and every double-take add up.
