{% comment %}
This file will prepend the image path `{{site.url}}/images/` to any image
that does not have two slashes `//` in the path. That way, an image url that
points to another website won't automatically have this website mistakenly
added to the front of the url.

A string beginning with a single slash will be prepended with {{ site.url }}

This file must NOT have an extra carriage return at the end.
